    <p>Hi – I’m Steve Hudek, the Founder and Creative Director for LoSoBe Marketing & Design. I care about things like the environment, the education of our children, world affairs, animal welfare – the list goes on. What it really boils down to is that I care about the impact I, and my business, have on family and friends, community, and the world. I bring who I am to LoSoBe because I believe that one cannot separate the person from the business. Therefore, the business is a reflection of me – my values, ethics, and character.</p>

    <p>In my work as a web developer and graphic designer, I came to know business owners who were passionate about what they were doing.  They were doing good work to make the world a better place. But, they were struggling because they weren’t connecting with like-minded customers.</p>

    <p>In order to bring about change, we need to connect with those who will support us in that change.</p>

    <p>We at LoSoBe are passionate about helping you connect authentically with your customers. Our goal is to help you:</p>

    <ul><li><strong>Look Good</strong> – Through design, advertising, leadership</li>
    <li><strong>Sound Good</strong> – Using communication, messaging, and connection</li>
    <li><strong>Be Good</strong> – Developing the relationship you have with your customers and the impact of your products and services.</li></ul>

    <p>Does the mere thought of promoting your business give you a funny feeling in the pit of your stomach? Perhaps even a bit of revulsion? Are you turned off by all the advertising and sales gimmicks out there? Don’t you wish there was a better way?</p>

    <p>We feel your pain. Because we’ve been there and done that (we didn’t get a t-shirt, though!).</p>

    <p>And because we’ve been there and done that, we’re here to guide, and help you, every step of the way.</p>

    <p>We take the mystery and uncertainty out of presenting your business (and by extension, yourself) by creatively and consciously collaborating with you, and staying with you every step of the way.</p>

    <p>You’re doing good in the world. Does anyone know it?</p>

    <p>Give us a call and let us show you how you can Look Good, Sound Good and Be Good – and create better relationships.</p>
